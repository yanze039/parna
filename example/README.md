# Example

This folder contains examples of how to use the `parna` package to model and parameterize RNA molecules. Each subfolder contains a specific example with its own README file that explains how to run the scripts and what the expected output is.

# The examples include:
- `00.generate_charge`: This example shows how to generate charges for non-canonical nucleotides.
- `01.extract_backbone`: This example demonstrates how to extract the backbone of an RNA molecule. This is for the cutomized modeling of chemically modified nucleotides based on a given RNA structure.
